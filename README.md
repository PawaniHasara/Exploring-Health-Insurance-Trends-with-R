# Exploring-Health-Insurance-Trends-with-R
This project is centered around a dataset that provides valuable insights into the world of health insurance. This dataset acts like a magnifying glass, allowing us to zoom in on different aspects of health insurance to better understand how they are connected. 

The dataset starts by giving each person a unique ID, like a name tag to keep things organized. We can see how old they are and whether they're a man or a woman. This helps us get a picture of who these insured individuals are. 

The dataset also tells us if people are at a healthy weight or not using something called BMI. It's like a measuring stick for how healthy you are based on your weight and height. We also know if they smoke, which can affect how much they pay for insurance and their overall health. 

People live in different parts of the United States, like the northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest. This can change how much they must pay for their healthcare. 

Simple Random Sampling employed the "rsampcalc" function in R to ascertain the sample size, facilitating an unbiased and random selection of individuals within the dataset, ensuring its representativeness. 

In contrast, Stratified Sampling delved into a stratification process based on "region" allowing for a more nuanced understanding of chargers of health insurance within different region groups by proportionally selecting individuals from homogeneous and exhaustive strata. 

Cluster Sampling, another distinctive method, organized the insured population into clusters based on the "age" variable. This technique involved a multi-stage sampling approach, drawing samples from selected clusters to offer a comprehensive portrayal of individuals.
